Work space to prepare a strong proposal for (modestly) extending the set of linguistic attributes to `<w>`.

See https://github.com/LingSIG/wordAttributes/wiki for a more thorough description.

A [project](https://github.com/orgs/LingSIG/projects/1) has been set up to group issues and tasks related to this initiative.

Please USE THE LOCAL FORK of the TEI repo, [in the wordAttributes branch](https://github.com/LingSIG/TEI/tree/wordAttributes), to prepare the pull request.

# wordAttributes

This is a repository of documents and encoding snippets, a basis for a feature request submitted to the TEI Technical Council concerning new inline attributes of the element `<w>`. We are aiming for minimally the trio of `@lemma`, `@pos` (for part-of-speech) and `@msd` (for morphosyntactic description).

The deliverable should be, minimally, 
* a set of definitions to be included in the source of the TEI Guidelines
* the prose to accompany those definitions in the text of the appropriate chapter
* short examples of use (for the documentation)
* possibly "Exempla" (more robust examples that can also act as a test suite)

Because we are assuming here simple cases with a single set of features for each `<w>`, it is not clear if it is worth to also suggest an attribute for the certainty score.
